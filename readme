Creating a hospital management system 

we should have modals and those modals are :
-Patients: 

 Notice!!!! that we have differents categories of patients there's patients cared by health assurance companies such as:
 e.g * CIGNA most known is the East-African countries
     * Globality
     *Expatplus
     *Global Health
     *etc...
  but other are not covered they take care of their hospital bills by them selves
